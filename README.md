Foreflight releases

Download the two zip files for access to files.  If opening a kml file to edit, make sure you right click and select to open with a text editor, otherwise it will try to launch in google earth.

Download google earth if using this to develop your own overlays.

NOTA BENE: As of 29 April, 2020 the Foreflight update changed the way Foreflight loads kmz files.  The images no longer load properly.  Any files loaded into Foreflight before this update remain as they were, but new kmz's loaded in will break.
