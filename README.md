Foreflight releases

To access the files: click on the most recent release below. Click on the zip file (should be the top one listed under Assets) and save to your device. Unzip first, then share each file to foreflight.

If opening a kml file to edit, make sure you right click and select to open with a text editor, otherwise it will try to launch in google earth.

Download google earth if using this to develop your own overlays.
